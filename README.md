# Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! This folder contains several machine learning and development projects that showcase my skills and experience in fraud detection, virtual environments, and general ML applications. Below, youâ€™ll find a brief introduction to each project.

---

## 1. [frauddetector](https://github.com/AnjaliMYP5/frauddetector)
A comprehensive solution for detecting fraudulent activities using machine learning techniques. This project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. It aims to accurately identify suspicious transactions and minimize false positives.

## 2. [venv](https://github.com/AnjaliMYP5/venv)
This repository demonstrates the setup and usage of Python virtual environments. Managing dependencies and project isolation is crucial for any data science or development workflow, and this project provides scripts and instructions for effective environment management.

## 3. [mlprojects](https://github.com/AnjaliMYP5/mlprojects)
A collection of diverse machine learning projects. Each subproject explores different algorithms, datasets, and real-world applications. This repository serves as a sandbox for experimenting with new techniques and approaches in data science.

## 4. [fraud-detection-mlproject](https://github.com/AnjaliMYP5/fraud-detection-mlproject)
Another fraud detection project focusing on end-to-end machine learning workflows. It covers data ingestion, cleaning, model selection, and deployment strategies for identifying fraudulent transactions in financial datasets.

## 5. [mlpro](https://github.com/AnjaliMYP5/mlpro)
A professional-grade machine learning repository featuring advanced models, data pipelines, and evaluation metrics. This project highlights best practices in ML engineering and serves as a reference for building robust data-driven applications.
