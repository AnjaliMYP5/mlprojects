def mock_predict_loan_status(features):
    """
    A mock prediction function that simulates a machine learning model.
    In a real-world scenario, you would load a trained model here (e.g., from scikit-learn).
    For example:
    import joblib
    model = joblib.load('your_trained_model.pkl')
    prediction = model.predict([features_as_list])
    
    This mock model uses simple rules for demonstration purposes.
    - A credit history of 1 (yes) greatly increases the chance of approval.
    - High income and low loan amount also contribute to approval.
